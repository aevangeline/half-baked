# Half-Baked
A personal time-keeping assistant tool made w/ love!

This is a personal project that maybe will blossom into more. The primary goals of this project are as follows.
- To create a simple, easy-to-use application that helps you keep track of what the heck you're want to be doing
- To provide a simple and high-quality code-base that is easy to maintain, portable, open source, and a good platform for people to learn open source culture/contribution models (myself included!)


Engineering Principles 
- Using high quality tools is more fun!
- Easy to understand > Clever
